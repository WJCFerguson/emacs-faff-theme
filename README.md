Emacs Faff Theme
================

A light theme intended to clear but calming and easy to look at.  Generally the dark-for-a-light-theme cornsilk3 background means that default text at full black means a reasonable balance between relaxation and clarity.

It originated from the Emacs default, but with a darker background and then
incremental tweaks on top.

The font in the screenshot is the beautiful Ubuntu Mono.

The general setup is for coding, and based on packages I have used, and therefore faces I've encountered and adjusted.  Mostly it uses standard named colors from the pallette.

**Please** if you find any faces that look out of place, or have other suggestions, submit issues or make pull requests.  `C-u C-x =` tells you what faces are under the cursor.  Fairly often the defaults for lighter colors are problematic with the middling intensity background.
