# Emacs Faff Theme

A light theme intended to clear but calming and unobtrusive.  The cornsilk3
background color choice was with high-end off-white notepaper in mind.  Being at
the darker end of light backgrounds, having default text at full black means a
reasonable contrast balance between relaxation and clarity.

**Please - suggestions and bug reports are gratefully received**.  If you find
something odd or unclear please submit issues or make pull requests.  Default
shades of lighter colors in particular have needed adjustment - e.g. I yellows
in the terminal.  `C-u C-x =` tells you what faces are under the cursor.

Mostly it uses standard named colors chosen at my whim from the X11 palette any
time the defaults didn't look good to me.  If something does not look good it
may be just something I haven't used - please tell me about it.

The font in the screenshot is the beautiful Ubuntu Mono.
